My little orange flowers

So wild and free.

They sit in the shade

Amongst the big oak tree.

I smile at them

And they wave to me.

My little orange flowers

They look so pretty.

The wind blows fast

So the orange flowers sway.

The storm is blowing in

The sky is dark gray.

The flowers seem to drown

As the rain comes hard.

I see little orange petals

They're floating through the yard.

The sun shines bright

It's a brand new day.

I see my little orange flowers

They're perfectly okay.
