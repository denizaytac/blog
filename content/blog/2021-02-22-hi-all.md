My little orange flowers\
So wild and free.\
They sit in the shade\
Amongst the big oak tree.\
I smile at them\
And they wave to me.\
My little orange flowers\
They look so pretty.\
The wind blows fast\
So the orange flowers sway.\
The storm is blowing in\
The sky is dark gray.\
The flowers seem to drown\
As the rain comes hard.\
I see little orange petals\
They're floating through the yard.\
The sun shines bright\
It's a brand new day.\
I see my little orange flowers\
They're perfectly okay.
